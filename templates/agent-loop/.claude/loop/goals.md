- Clean up old log files and temporary data
- Verify all infrastructure components are working

## Exploration
- Research new capabilities that could be useful
- Experiment with new tools or approaches
- Explore the codebase for improvement opportunities
- Test edge cases in existing systems

## Communication
- Check inbox for new messages or tasks
- Update memory with current state
- Create status reports in notifications
